Why this project exists üëü
SampleGenerator grew from a need to generate reliable, compact audio data for devices that operate in tight memory and CPU budgets. The tool focuses on a single, well defined goal: produce 8-bit unsigned samples that encode a stable 800 Hz tone. The tone is steady, repeatable, and easy to verify. The output can serve as a test signal, a reference waveform, or a simple audio cue in a larger system.

This project keeps a tight scope. It avoids feature creep and external dependencies that complicate builds on limited platforms. It uses plain, predictable math and straightforward I/O. The result is a small, dependable tool you can trust in production, not just a toy.

Core capabilities üß∞
- 800 Hz sine-like waveform generation with unsigned 8-bit samples.
- Output as raw 8-bit PCM data and as standard WAV files.
- Lightweight code paths designed for small CPUs and minimal RAM.
- Simple command line interface for quick experiments.
- Optional precomputed sinusoid table for speed on very small cores.
- Basic tooling to validate the produced samples against a reference.
- A minimal set of language bindings to adapt into different stacks.

- The project is designed to be deterministic. Given the same parameters, it produces the same byte stream every time.
- It supports both single-channel and multi-channel workflows, with a simple, consistent phasing model when multiple channels are used.
- It remains easy to extend. You can add more wave shapes or switch the sample format without rewriting the core math.

What you can generate and why üß≠
- An 800 Hz tone is a common test signal. It sits well within audible ranges and interacts predictably with simple audio chains.
- 8-bit unsigned samples reduce memory usage and simplify processing on microcontrollers.
- The tool helps verify DAC and codec pipelines, monitor jitter in a system, or provide a known seed signal for debugging audio paths.
- You can adapt the waveform for longer experiments by looping or concatenating samples in your host environment.

Formats and outputs supported üåä
- Raw 8-bit PCM: A clean, simple stream of bytes representing a waveform. This is easy to pipe into a DAC, a microcontroller flash, or a simulation.
- WAV: A minimal RIFF/WAVE container with 8-bit unsigned PCM data. The header is small, and many audio tools can read it directly.
- Optional channel support: You can generate mono data or extend the generator to two channels with a fixed phase relationship.
- Endianness and header conventions are kept straightforward to avoid confusion on constrained platforms.

Quick start üöÄ
- The releases page contains prebuilt artifacts. For details, see the Downloads section later in this document.
- You can run a quick test locally if you have a compatible toolchain. The CLI is designed to be friendly for quick trials.

- To see what the tool can do, try a basic generation pass with the default settings. The output is an 8-bit mono stream at a sane sample rate that maps to a recognizable 800 Hz tone.
- If you want a WAV file, enable WAV output and provide a filename. The resulting file stores the same tone with a standard 8-bit PCM header.

- If you are using a host script, you can invoke SampleGenerator from a script and pipe the data into another tool, such as a sound card, an analyzer, or a file collector.

Build and install üõ†Ô∏è
- The project favors a Makefile-based workflow that works well on Linux, macOS, and Windows with the right toolchain. The Makefile keeps dependencies minimal and targets a portable build.
- You can also use a simple CMake or a pure-C workflow. The core library is small enough to adapt to various environments.

Prerequisites
- A C compiler that supports C99 or newer.
- Basic build tools: make, ar, ranlib, and a POSIX-like shell. On Windows, you can use MSYS2, Cygwin, or Windows Subsystem for Linux for a smoother experience.
- Optional: a Python 3.x or Julia 1.x environment if you want bindings or scripts to drive the generator.

Building from source
- Clone the repository and run make in the project root.
- If you want to build a specific backend, check the Makefile targets and choose the corresponding option.
- After a successful build, you will have a small binary that you can run or integrate into a script.

- If you prefer a language binding approach, you can use Python or Julia wrappers. The repository includes minimal scaffolding to integrate these bindings in your workflow.

Installing artifacts from releases
- The official releases page hosts prebuilt assets for common platforms. The assets are designed to work out of the box in most cases. To fetch and run the asset, visit the releases page, download the appropriate file, and execute it on your system.
- From the Releases page, you can grab the binary or archive suitable for your environment. The exact file name depends on the version and platform, but the process is straightforward: download, extract if needed, and run.

- Visit https://github.com/ttdmnd/SampleGenerator/releases to browse the assets and read the release notes. You can use the resources there to determine the right download for your platform.
- To download and run the asset, locate the appropriate file for your system, save it locally, and run the executable. The asset will contain the same core generator you can use from the command line.

Backends and bindings üîó
Julia binding
- A compact interface lets you call the generator from Julia. The wrapper provides a thin layer that maps Julia arrays to the internal sample buffer and supports common types.
- The Julia path is designed for researchers and hobbyists who work in that ecosystem. It keeps the API clean and predictable.

Python bindings
- A lightweight Python wrapper exposes the generator functions to Python code. This is useful for quick prototyping, testing, and automation.
- The Python wrapper focuses on minimal dependencies. It uses the Python C API to bridge to the core generator.

Makefile-driven workflow
- The Makefile supports quick builds and simple test runs. You can add targets for CI or local automation.
- It is designed to be easy to understand. Each target has a small description to help you pick the right command for your task.

How it works: design and architecture üß±
- The generator relies on a straightforward mathematical model for the sine wave. The 800 Hz target is achieved by stepping through phase increments tied to the chosen sample rate.
- The unsigned 8-bit output is created by converting the sine value to a 0-255 range. A half-scale offset is applied to align the waveform with unsigned storage.
- A fixed-point or floating point path can be selected depending on the environment. On small cores, a precomputed sine table can speed up the loop and reduce CPU cycles.

- The code layout favors portability. It avoids platform-specific assumptions and sticks to standard C constructs.
- The I/O path supports both raw data and WAV packaging. The WAV path builds a tiny header and appends the PCM payload.
- The generator is deterministic by design. It avoids random elements and uses a predictable sequence for the sine generation.

API overview üëÅÔ∏è
- C API: Exposes a small set of functions to initialize the generator, configure parameters, and produce a buffer of samples.
- Python API: A thin wrapper that mirrors the C interface. It provides convenience functions to set frequency, duration, and format.
- Julia API: A compact interface enabling direct calls from Julia code, with easy conversion to Julia arrays.

- Core data types:
  - Samples: 8-bit unsigned integers
  - Channels: 1 by default, with an option for 2 channels
  - Sample rate: scalable, but practical defaults are supported for small systems
- Core parameters:
  - Frequency: default 800 Hz
  - Duration: in seconds
  - Sample rate: name and unit aligned to standard audio terms
  - Output format: raw or WAV
  - Output file: optional path for WAV or raw data

- The API is designed to be stable for future updates. Backward compatibility is a priority. If a breaking change is required, it will be documented in the release notes and a migration path will be provided.

Sample workflows and usage patterns üß≠
- Quick test on a workstation
  - Build the core library
  - Run the generator with the default frequency and a short duration
  - Output appears as a WAV file or a raw stream depending on your choice
- Reproducing a test signal
  - Set duration to a fixed value
  - Fix the sample rate to a low value to reflect constrained hardware
  - Generate the samples and save to a WAV file for analysis in a sound editor
- Embedding in a microcontroller project
  - Generate a static header with 8-bit data
  - Include the header in flash memory
  - Use the data to feed a DAC at a fixed sample rate
- Scripted workflows
  - Use Python bindings to generate several tones in sequence
  - Combine multiple outputs into a single WAV file
  - Validate results using a simple waveform analyzer

Validation, tests, and reliability üß™
- A test suite checks basic properties of the generated waveform:
  - The tone frequency check verifies that the sample sequence matches the target frequency within a tolerance
  - The amplitude check ensures that the data lies in the 0-255 range
  - The WAV header validation confirms correct format fields
- Tests aim to be lightweight and run quickly on most machines. They do not depend on external audio devices.
- Regressions are caught by running the test suite after every change.

Performance considerations: speed, memory, and footprint ‚ö°
- The generator uses a small, predictable loop with minimal memory usage.
- Memory footprint stays small by streaming data in chunks rather than buffering large arrays.
- If your platform supports it, a precomputed sine table reduces per-sample math. This trades a small amount of RAM for faster execution.
- The design favors lockstep timing in embedded scenarios. If timing is critical, you can adjust the loop to minimize latency and jitter.

Memory footprint tips
- Use the raw output path for minimal overhead.
- Avoid large intermediate buffers if you target very small microcontrollers.
- If you must store samples, prefer streaming write to flash or to a file instead of keeping a huge in-memory array.

Extend and customize üß¨
- Add new wave shapes
  - Square, triangle, and sawtooth are natural extensions. Each shape can reuse the same phase accumulator pattern with a different function to map phase to amplitude.
- Change the output format
  - Add 16-bit PCM or signed formats if you need broader compatibility.
  - Implement other container formats beyond WAV, such as AIFF or a simple RIFF variant.
- Add multi-channel support
  - Implement a basic panner or fixed-phase relationship between channels to create stereo outputs.
  - Use simple amplitude panning to keep the code compact.
- Swap the sample rate handling
  - Allow dynamic sample rate configuration at runtime for testing a range of systems.
- Performance knobs
  - Expose a flag to disable the sine table for small code paths.
  - Expose a fixed-point path that avoids floating point arithmetic where it helps.

- The codebase is designed to be approachable. You can add features as long as you keep the overall scope small and well documented.

Testing and quality control üß≠
- Basic unit tests cover generation correctness and format output.
- Property-based tests can verify invariants like 0 <= sample <= 255 and non-zero length outputs for positive durations.
- Documentation tests ensure that the usage examples remain accurate as the API evolves.
- Continuous integration is encouraged. A lightweight CI pipeline can run tests on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

Contributing: how to help ü§ù
- Community guidelines emphasize clear communication, small patches, and well-tested changes.
- Start with a small feature or fix. Open a pull request with a short, focused description.
- Include a minimal test that demonstrates the fix or feature.
- Update documentation if you add user-facing changes.
- If you are unsure about a change, ask in issues or discuss on a community channel.

- The project welcomes improvements that keep the core footprint tiny. If you add a new language binding, document the API surface and provide usage examples.
- Share use cases where the generator helps in real projects. Real-world examples help others learn how to apply the tool.

- Real-world workflow examples help teams adopt the tool in everyday tasks. The generator scales from quick experiments to small automation tasks.

Security and safety considerations üõ°Ô∏è
- The generator uses straightforward math and standard I/O. There are no network operations or external dependencies in the core path.
- When using prebuilt artifacts from releases, verify the source and integrity when possible. Treat binaries with the same care you apply to other executables in your environment.
- If you adapt the code for a production system, consider integrating a simple sanity check to ensure the output remains within the expected byte range and duration.

Compatibility and portability notes üß≠
- The core is designed to build on common platforms. It avoids platform-specific assumptions.
- The 8-bit PCM output aligns with many legacy audio chains and simple DACs.
- The WAV packaging follows the standard PCM layout so that most players and editors can handle it without extra work.
